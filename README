== Welcome to Bookmarkable

Bookmarkable provides a very small web service that lets you paste a bookmark
and save it to your database.  There's no "fluff" such as user authentication,
account management or anything of the like.  

More than anything, this is a project for me to learn git and to explore 
Rails > 2.2 development.  As such, I have no plans to back port to earlier
versions of Rails.

Since the goal of this project is to learn git, rails, and the so-called
"rails-way," I'd love to hear any and all feedback and criticism for the 
code-base and my coding techniques.  Feel free to email me, Michael Lang, at:
